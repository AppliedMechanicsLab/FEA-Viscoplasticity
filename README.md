# FEA-Viscoplasticity-
FEA Viscoplasticity code

The main file is `ViscoPlasticity.nb`
It imports the FEA mesh from `/mesh/a1000.inp`.
The mesh contains both triangular elements and quadrilateral elements.
Solution files of displacement field and stress field in each step is too large to be uploaded to Github.

I refer the viscoplastic model from [Prof. Bower's Applied Mechanics of Solid](http://solidmechanics.org/Text/Chapter8_5/Chapter8_5.php) book.
